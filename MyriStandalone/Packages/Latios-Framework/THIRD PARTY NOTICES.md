Notes: Parts and ideas heavily modified and adapted for Unity DOTS. This is the
repository associated with *Game Physics Engine Development â€“ 2nd Edition*. So
far it has been a great book and I am using it as a guide for implementing
simulation logic in Psyshock, since I am not as strong in that area compared to
spatial algorithms.
